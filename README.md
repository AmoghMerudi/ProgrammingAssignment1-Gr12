# **Movie Genre Visualization** ðŸŽ¥  

## **Overview**  
This project visualizes movies and their genres by creating interactive star charts using **p5.js**. Each genre is represented as a group, and the movies within that genre are displayed as stars, with size and brightness influenced by their popularity and revenue, respectively. Users can click on a star to display details about a selected movie.
